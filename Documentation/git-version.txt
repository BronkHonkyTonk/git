git-version - Display version information about Git


SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'git version' [--build-options]


DESCRIPTION
-----------

on the standard output.

If the option `--build-options` is given, information about how git was built is
printed on the standard output in addition to the version number.

Note that `git --version` is identical to `git version` because the
former is internally converted into the latter.

	purposes.
