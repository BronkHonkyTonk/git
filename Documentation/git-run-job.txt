NAME
----
git-run-job - Run a maintenance job. Intended for background operation.


SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'git run-job <job-name>'


DESCRIPTION
-----------

Run a maintenance job on the current repository. This is available as a
command for a few reasons. First, the background job feature can launch
these commands on a schedule and each process will completely clear its
memory when complete. Second, an expert user could create their own job
schedule by running these jobs themselves.

THIS COMMAND IS EXPERIMENTAL. THE SET OF AVAILABLE JOBS OR THEIR EXACT
BEHAVIOR MAY BE ALTERED IN THE FUTURE.
