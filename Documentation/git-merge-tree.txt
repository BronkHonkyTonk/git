git-merge-tree(1)
=================

NAME
----
git-merge-tree - Perform merge without touching index or working tree


SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'git merge-tree' --real <branch1> <branch2>
'git merge-tree' <base-tree> <branch1> <branch2>

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Performs a merge, but does not make any new commits and does not read
from or write to either the working tree or index.

The first form will merge the two branches, doing a full recursive
merge with rename detection.  If the merge is clean, the exit status
will be `0`, and if the merge has conflicts, the exit status will be
`1`.  The output will consist solely of the resulting toplevel tree
(which may have files including conflict markers).

The second form is meant for backward compatibility and will only do a
trival merge.  It reads three tree-ish, and outputs trivial merge
results and conflicting stages to the standard output in a semi-diff
format.  Since this was designed for higher level scripts to consume
and merge the results back into the index, it omits entries that match
<branch1>.  The result of this second form is is similar to what
three-way 'git read-tree -m' does, but instead of storing the results
in the index, the command outputs the entries to the standard output.
