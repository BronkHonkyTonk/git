	Specify the browser that will be used to display help in the
	'web' format. See linkgit:git-help[1].

	Values 'man', 'info', 'web' and 'html' are supported. 'man' is
	the default. 'web' and 'html' are the same.

help.autoCorrect::
	If git detects typos and can identify exactly one valid command similar
	to the error, git will try to suggest the correct command or even
	run the intended command.
	If this config value is 0, then the suggested command will be shown.
	If it is positive, the suggested command will automatically
	run after waiting for that many deciseconds (0.1 sec).
	If it is "immediate", the suggested command will be
	run immediately.
	If it is "prompt", then the user will be shown the
	suggestion and will be prompted for confirmation before the command
	is run.
	If it is "never", then no suggestion will be shown and no command
	will be run.
	0 is the default value for this config.

help.htmlPath::
	Specify the path where the HTML documentation resides. File system paths
	and URLs are supported. HTML pages will be prefixed with this path when
	help is displayed in the 'web' format. This defaults to the documentation
	path of your Git installation.
