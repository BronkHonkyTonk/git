job.pack-files.batchSize::
	This string value `<size>` will be passed to the
	`git multi-pack-index repack --batch-size=<size>` command as
	part of `git run-job pack-files`. If not specified, then a
	dynamic size calculation is run. See linkgit:git-run-job[1]
	for more details.

job.repo::
	Store an absolute path to a repository that wants background
	jobs run by `git job-runner`. This is a multi-valued config
	option, but it must be stored in a config file seen by the
	background runner. This may be the global or system config
	depending on how `git job-runner` is launched on your system.
