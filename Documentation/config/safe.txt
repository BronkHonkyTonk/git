safe.barerepository::
	This config entry specifies directories that Git can recognize as
	a bare repository when looking for the repository (aka repository
	discovery). This has no effect if repository discovery is not
	performed e.g. the path to the repository is set via `--git-dir`
	(see linkgit:git[1]).
+
It is recommended that you set this value so that Git will only use the bare
repositories you intend it to. This prevents certain types of security and
non-security problems, such as:

* `git clone`-ing a repository containing a maliciously bare repository
  inside it.
* Git recognizing a directory that isn't mean to be a bare repository,
  but happens to look like one.
+
The currently supported values are `*` (Git recognizes all bare
repositories) and the empty value (Git never recognizes bare repositories).
Defaults to `*`.
+
This config setting is only respected when specified in a system or global
config, not when it is specified in a repository config or via the command
line option `-c safe.barerepository=<path>`.

safe.directory::
	These config entries specify Git-tracked directories that are
	considered safe even if they are owned by someone other than the
	current user. By default, Git will refuse to even parse a Git
	config of a repository owned by someone else, let alone run its
	hooks, and this config setting allows users to specify exceptions,
	e.g. for intentionally shared repositories (see the `--shared`
	option in linkgit:git-init[1]).
+
This is a multi-valued setting, i.e. you can add more than one directory
via `git config --add`. To reset the list of safe directories (e.g. to
override any such directories specified in the system config), add a
`safe.directory` entry with an empty value.
+
This config setting is only respected when specified in a system or global
config, not when it is specified in a repository config or via the command
line option `-c safe.directory=<path>`.
+
The value of this setting is interpolated, i.e. `~/<path>` expands to a
path relative to the home directory and `%(prefix)/<path>` expands to a
path relative to Git's (runtime) prefix.
+
To completely opt-out of this security check, set `safe.directory` to the
string `*`. This will allow all repositories to be treated as if their
directory was listed in the `safe.directory` list. If `safe.directory=*`
is set in system config and you want to re-enable this protection, then
initialize your list with an empty value before listing the repositories
that you deem safe.
